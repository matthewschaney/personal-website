# Personal Website

My personal portfolio and website — lightweight, fast, and accessible. Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step required.  

Deployed at [schaney.net](https://schaney.net).

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:<username>/portfolio.git

```

To customize:
1. Edit content in `index.html` (name, bio, links).
2. Update `projects.json` with real projects.
3. Drop a PDF résumé in `assets/YourName_Resume.pdf`.
4. Replace icons in `assets/` (`favicon.svg`, `og-image.png`).
